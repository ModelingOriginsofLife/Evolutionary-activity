Evolutionary-activity
=====================

Evolutionary activity is a visual and statistical approach to analyzing evolutionary processes.

Evolutionary activity is used to analyze an evolutionary process consisting of a population of entities that change over time.  Typically, the entities interact with each other, and as a result of the interactions, some entities may survive preferentially over others.  If entities have survival that is significantly longer than a randomly changing population with no selection, the entities acquire evolutionary activity.
