Evolutionary-activity
=====================

Evolutionary activity is a visual and statistical approach to analyzing evolutionary processes.

Evolutionary activity is used to analyze an evolutionary process consisting of a population of entities that change over time.  Typically, the entities interact with each other, and as a result of the interactions, some entities may survive preferentially over others.  If entities have survival that is significantly longer than a randomly changing population with no selection, the entities acquire evolutionary activity.

$a_i^t = \Sum_{t'=0}^{t} c_i^t'$


To do:

1. reorganize so that instead of starting evolutionary program separately from graphactivity.py, the evolutionary program is passed to graphactivity.py on the command line, and lauched by that script.  

2.  eliminate flat line clutter

3.  add graph windows for  total activity vs. time and new activity vs. time.
